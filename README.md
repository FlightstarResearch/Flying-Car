# Flying Car
A flying car is a type of personal air vehicle or roadable aircraft that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air. The term **flying car** is also sometimes used to include hovercars.

## Introduction
## Structure of the Flying-car
## Operating System of the Flying-car
## Open Source
## Implementation
### [Backyard Flyer](/Document/Build-Drone-for-you.md)
Write event-driven code to get your drone to take-off, fly a predetermined path, and land in a simulated backyard environment.
### 3D Motion Planning
Move beyond the backyard test grounds and fly your drone around a complex urban environment. To do so, you will **load a map of a real city, plan a collision-free path between buildings**, and watch your drone fly above city streets.
### Building a Controller
Implementation different motions (slow, fast, slalom, etc.) and analyze performance under different conditions.
### Estimation devices
implement an EKF (Extended Kalman filter) to estimate altitude and position from IMU and GPS data of a flying robot. After doing so, you will have implemented the full-stack for aerial robot
### Fixed-Wing Control
Write code a fixed-wing aircraft, and then implement solutions to a significantly more challenging control problem.

In this project you will code a fixed-wing aircraft, and then implement solutions to a significantly more challenging control problem.
